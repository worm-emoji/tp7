# TP-7 CLI Research Spec

## Purpose

Build a macOS CLI for Teenage Engineering TP-7 file access.

The first implementation target is a robust Rust-based MTP file manager that can detect the TP-7, switch or validate MTP mode, list files, and transfer recordings. Finder-style mounting is valuable, but should be treated as a later layer because MTP is object-based and macOS mounting requires FUSE infrastructure.

## Current Decision

Use Rust.

Recommended initial stack:

- `mtp-rs` for a pure Rust MTP implementation.
- `nusb` indirectly through `mtp-rs` for USB access.
- `clap` for CLI parsing.
- `tracing` or `log` for diagnostics.
- Later: `fuser` plus macFUSE or Fuse-T for filesystem mounting.

Avoid `libmtp` in the first prototype unless `mtp-rs` cannot handle the TP-7 reliably. FieldKit uses `libmtp`, so it remains a proven fallback.

## Connected Device Findings

Observed on macOS with the TP-7 plugged in and powered on.

Device identity:

- Product: `TP-7`
- Vendor string: `teenage engineering`
- Vendor ID: `0x2367`
- Product ID: `0x0019`
- Serial: `F1RTL11C`
- USB speed: high speed, 480 Mbps
- USB version: 2.0
- Current USB configuration: `1`
- Number of USB configurations: `3`

Default visible mode is not MTP. macOS sees the TP-7 as a composite USB audio/MIDI device:

- Interface 0: USB Audio Control
- Interface 1: USB Audio Streaming input
- Interface 2: USB Audio Streaming output
- Interface 3: USB MIDI

Current owners:

- `usbaudiod` owns the audio interfaces.
- `MIDIServer` owns the MIDI interface and also appears as the device-level exclusive owner.
- `FieldKit.app` has a USB device user client attached.
- `Dia.app` also had a USB device user client attached during inspection.

A descriptor-only libusb probe showed all three available USB configurations expose the same audio/MIDI interface set in the current device mode. No MTP or mass-storage interface was visible at that point.

Confirmed: TP-7 needs a device-specific MIDI SysEx mode switch before it re-enumerates as MTP. The MTP interface is not merely hidden in another visible configuration while the device is in audio/MIDI mode.

After a successful switch, `nusb` sees:

- Product: `TP-7 MTP Device`
- Mode inference: `mtp`
- Interface: vendor-specific `255:1:1`, string `MTP TETP interface`

The TP-7 may return to audio/MIDI mode after a short MTP session closes. File commands should therefore switch, open MTP, perform their work, and close the session as one operation instead of assuming that a previous `tp7 connect` leaves the device in MTP for long.

## FieldKit Findings

The installed `/Applications/FieldKit.app` is strong evidence for how Teenage Engineering handles this on macOS.

Observed from local binary metadata:

- FieldKit version: `2.0`, bundle build `210`.
- It links against bundled `libmtp.dylib`.
- It links against bundled `libusb.dylib`.
- It has the `com.apple.security.device.usb` entitlement.
- It does not appear to bundle macFUSE/Fuse-T components.

Observed strings and logs indicate:

- FieldKit has a `MTPService`.
- FieldKit has USB probing code.
- FieldKit detects mass storage, MIDI, and MTP interfaces.
- FieldKit knows whether a device `supportsMTP` and `supportsStartingMTP`.
- FieldKit can re-enumerate the device.
- FieldKit sends MIDI `greet` and `mode` requests.
- FieldKit then opens the MTP device with libmtp.

Practical inference:

FieldKit sends a Teenage Engineering-specific MIDI request to switch the TP-7 from audio/MIDI mode into MTP mode, waits for USB re-enumeration, and then opens the re-enumerated MTP device through libmtp/libusb.

The exact mode-switch payload has been validated independently through CoreMIDI and implemented directly in Rust. FieldKit/Dia remain research references only, not runtime dependencies.

## Teenage Engineering SysEx Findings

TP-7 exposes a CoreMIDI source and destination named `TP-7` in audio/MIDI mode.

Device identity request:

- Send universal MIDI identity request: `f0 7e 7f 06 01 f7`
- Observed response: `f0 7e 19 06 02 00 20 76 19 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 f7`
- `0x19` is the runtime device id used in the TE SysEx envelope.

TE SysEx envelope:

- Manufacturer id: `00 20 76`
- TE marker byte: `40`
- Request with request id flag: `0x60`
- Response with request id flag: `0x20`
- Request id: 12 bits split as high 5 bits in the low bits of the flag byte and low 7 bits in the next byte.
- Payload is TE 8-bit data packed into 7-bit-safe SysEx bytes.

Generic request shape:

```text
f0 00 20 76 <device-id> 40 <flags> <request-id-low7> <command> <packed-payload> f7
```

Validated commands:

- `0x01` greet: returns semicolon-separated metadata.
- `0x04` mode: changes USB mode.

Observed greet request:

```text
f0 00 20 76 19 40 60 01 01 f7
```

Observed greet metadata:

```text
mode:normal;product:TP-7;sw_version:1.1.9;os_version:1.1.9;serial:F1RTL11C;sku:TE025AS001;base_sku:TE025AS001
```

Validated MTP switch request:

```text
f0 00 20 76 19 40 60 05 04 00 01 03 f7
```

That is command `0x04` with unpacked payload `[0x01, 0x03]`. FieldKit also contains a legacy-looking path that can send `[0x01, 0x02]`; keep it as a fallback if `[0x01, 0x03]` receives TE status `0x03` (`bad-request`).

Validated response to the MTP switch:

```text
f0 00 20 76 19 40 20 05 04 00 f7
```

Status `0x00` means success. After this response, the device re-enumerates and can be opened via `mtp-rs`.

## Protocol Findings

MTP is not a block storage protocol. It exposes object operations over a request/response protocol. A CLI can list, transfer, delete, and rename objects directly. A POSIX-looking mounted directory requires translation and caching.

Useful MTP concepts for implementation:

- Device sessions are explicit.
- Storage IDs identify storage roots.
- Object handles identify files/folders.
- Paths are not native protocol identifiers; the CLI must resolve paths to object handles.
- File writes are object uploads, not arbitrary block writes.
- Many POSIX write patterns do not map cleanly to MTP.
- Deletes and renames are protocol operations if supported by the device.

Core MTP operations likely needed for v1:

- Open session
- Get device info
- Get storage IDs
- Get storage info
- Get object handles
- Get object info
- Get object
- Send object info
- Send object
- Delete object
- Set object property or rename operation, depending on device support

## macOS Constraints

macOS has no native Finder-level MTP support. Teenage Engineering documents FieldKit as the macOS solution because Windows and Linux support MTP natively.

Potential process conflicts:

- FieldKit
- Dia
- Android File Transfer or similar MTP apps
- `ptpcamerad`, if a device re-enumerates as a Still Image/PTP/MTP class device

The CLI should detect and report likely conflicts rather than failing with a generic USB error.

For mounting, macOS requires a FUSE-compatible runtime:

- macFUSE: mature, but requires kernel extension approval or newer FSKit paths depending on version/macOS.
- Fuse-T: kext-less, attractive for distribution, but needs validation with Rust FUSE tooling.

V1 should not require FUSE.

## Rust Tooling

Preferred:

- `mtp-rs`: pure Rust MTP implementation, built on `nusb`. This avoids C dependencies and should be the first prototype path.
- `fuser`: Rust FUSE library for a future mount layer.

Fallback:

- `libmtp` through FFI or a small C/Rust bridge. This is proven by FieldKit but introduces a C dependency and LGPL considerations.

Open validation tasks:

- Confirmed: `mtp-rs` can open the TP-7 once it is in MTP mode.
- Confirm object listing and transfers work with TP-7 recordings.
- Confirm whether `mtp-rs` exposes all required operations or whether we need small extensions.
- Confirm whether `nusb` can handle any macOS device ownership edge cases cleanly.

Validated MTP status from `mtp-rs`:

- Manufacturer: `teenage engineering`
- Model: `TP-7 MTP Device`
- Device version: `1.1.9`
- MTP serial: `F1RTL11C`
- Supports rename: `true`
- Storage count: `1`
- Storage id: `65537`
- Capacity: `120244404224` bytes
- Free space observed: `112986914816` bytes

## Go Tooling Considered

Go is feasible but less attractive for this project.

Options:

- `go-mtpfs`: useful as a historical reference for MTP/FUSE behavior.
- `go-fuse`: possible for a future mount, but macOS support is less straightforward.
- Go plus `libmtp` via cgo: likely robust but less appealing than pure Rust.

Decision: keep Go as reference material only.

## CLI Design

Executable name: `tp7`

Global flags:

- `--device <serial>`: select a specific TP-7.
- `--json`: machine-readable output.
- `--verbose`: show USB/MTP diagnostic logs.
- `--auto-connect`: allow file commands to switch into MTP mode automatically.
- `--no-progress`: disable progress bars for scripts.

### V1 Commands

`tp7 devices`

List connected TP-7 devices. Show serial, USB mode, whether MTP appears available, and whether another app appears to own the device.

`tp7 status`

Show model, serial, firmware if available, battery if available, storage capacity/free space, and current mode.

`tp7 connect`

Switch the TP-7 into MTP mode if needed, wait for re-enumeration, and validate the MTP session. In v1, file commands should not silently switch modes unless `--auto-connect` is set.

`tp7 doctor`

Diagnose common macOS problems: TP-7 not found, FieldKit/Dia/Android File Transfer conflict, MTP mode unavailable, USB permission issues, and later FUSE availability.

`tp7 ls [remote-path]`

List files/folders. Default path is `/`.

Useful flags:

- `--long`
- `--ids`
- `--json`

`tp7 tree [remote-path]`

Show recursive explorer output.

Useful flags:

- `--depth <n>`
- `--ids`
- `--json`

`tp7 stat <remote-path>`

Show metadata for one object: name, type, size, modified date, object ID, parent ID, and storage ID.

`tp7 pull <remote-path> [local-path]`

Download a file or directory from the TP-7.

Useful flags:

- `--recursive`
- `--overwrite`
- `--skip-existing`
- `--dry-run`

`tp7 push <local-path> <remote-path>`

Upload a file or directory to the TP-7.

Useful flags:

- `--recursive`
- `--overwrite`
- `--dry-run`

`tp7 mkdir <remote-path>`

Create a folder.

Useful flag:

- `--parents`

`tp7 rm <remote-path>`

Delete a file or directory.

Useful flags:

- `--recursive`
- `--force`
- `--dry-run`

`tp7 rename <remote-path> <new-name>`

Rename an object without moving it.

`tp7 eject`

Close the MTP session cleanly. If the reverse mode-switch command is discovered later, this can optionally return the device to audio/MIDI mode.

### Future Commands

`tp7 mount <mountpoint>`

Mount the TP-7 as a read-only filesystem. Requires macFUSE or Fuse-T.

`tp7 mount <mountpoint> --read-write`

Read-write mount with local write staging and upload-on-close semantics.

`tp7 sync <remote-path> <local-path>`

One-way sync from TP-7 to Mac. This is likely the most useful workflow command for recordings.

`tp7 import [local-dir]`

Opinionated copy-new-recordings command with duplicate detection.

`tp7 mv <remote-source> <remote-dest>`

Remote move if TP-7 supports it reliably. Otherwise this must be copy/delete and should wait.

`tp7 cp <remote-source> <remote-dest>`

Remote copy if TP-7 supports it reliably.

`tp7 cat <remote-file>`

Stream a small remote file to stdout.

## Current Interface Decisions

Current choices:

- Keep `tp7 connect` explicit by default.
- Make `--auto-connect` opt-in for commands like `ls` and `pull`.
- Use POSIX-like remote paths beginning at `/`.
- Treat multiple storage roots as hidden behind `/` unless the device exposes more than one usable storage.
- Make destructive operations require explicit paths and support `--dry-run`.
- Keep v1 mount-free.

## Implementation Plan

Phases 0 through 4 now have working prototype coverage: CLI scaffolding, USB detection, diagnostics, CoreMIDI mode switching, MTP status validation, shared session handling, and read-only file exploration. Phase 5 has started with direct `tp7 pull` downloads.

### Phase 0: Baseline Project

Create a small Rust CLI skeleton with command parsing, structured errors, and logging. No MTP behavior yet.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 --help`
- command stubs
- basic JSON output mode

### Phase 1: USB Detection

Detect connected TP-7 devices by vendor/product ID and serial.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 devices`
- `tp7 doctor` can identify basic conflicts
- tests around output formatting where practical

### Phase 2: MTP Mode Discovery

Learn and implement the TP-7 mode-switch path.

Candidate approaches:

- First try manual FieldKit-assisted MTP mode, then see if our tool can open MTP.
- Inspect macOS logs around FieldKit mode switching.
- Capture CoreMIDI/USB MIDI SysEx traffic if needed.
- Reproduce the MIDI mode request once understood.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 connect` can put the TP-7 into MTP mode or clearly explain what manual step is needed.

### Phase 3: MTP Session

Open an MTP session with `mtp-rs` and read basic device/storage information.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 status`
- storage capacity/free-space reporting

### Phase 4: Read-Only File Explorer

Implement object tree traversal and remote path resolution.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 ls` (implemented for folder listings, file targets, `--long`, `--ids`, and `--json`)
- `tp7 tree` (implemented for recursive folder output, `--depth`, `--ids`, and `--json`)
- `tp7 stat` (implemented for file/folder object metadata and `--json`)

### Phase 5: Transfers

Implement downloads first, then uploads.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 pull` (implemented for files and recursive folders, with `--dry-run`, `--overwrite`, and `--skip-existing`)
- `tp7 push` (implemented for files, with `--dry-run` and `--overwrite`; directory upload is still deferred)
- progress reporting
- skip/overwrite behavior

### Phase 6: Mutations

Implement safer write operations after listing and transfer are proven.

Deliverable:

- `tp7 mkdir` (command implemented, but TP-7 firmware 1.1.9 rejected folder creation with MTP `GeneralError`)
- `tp7 rename` (implemented and smoke-tested on a pushed file)
- `tp7 rm` (implemented and smoke-tested on a pushed file)
- dry-run behavior

### Phase 7: Mount Research

Prototype a read-only FUSE mount after the direct MTP CLI is stable.

Deliverable:

- decision between macFUSE and Fuse-T
- read-only `tp7 mount <mountpoint>` prototype

## Risks

Unknown TP-7 mode-switch request:

- FieldKit strongly suggests the mode switch is MIDI-based, but the payload is not known yet.

macOS USB ownership:

- Audio/MIDI mode is owned by system services.
- MTP mode may be claimed by other apps or macOS camera services.

MTP semantics:

- Object handles can change across sessions.
- Path resolution must be built on object metadata.
- Writes cannot behave exactly like normal filesystem writes.

Library risk:

- `mtp-rs` may need fixes or extensions for TP-7 quirks.
- `libmtp` fallback is likely reliable but adds C dependency and licensing considerations.

Mount risk:

- Finder-style mounting is a separate product surface with caching, partial writes, metadata, and macOS FUSE distribution concerns.
